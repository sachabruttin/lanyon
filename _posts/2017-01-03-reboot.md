As a new year has just begun, it is time to take good resolutions. So I decided to give my blog a new life.

<img src="/public/images/2017-01-03-reboot/keep-calm-and-reboot.png" height="250" class="align-center" alt="Keep Calm and Reboot"/>

Until now this blog was in French. From now on it will be in English in order to reach a wider audience. It will also deal with the subjects that I am currently passionate about,
that is the cloud computing in general and Azure in particular. But I do not forget my previous loves and I would come back on subjects like UWP, Xamarin and ASP.NET ...

Stay tunned for more posts very soon...
